# Simple Drone Simulator for Educational Purposes Based on Babylon.js
This simulator was created as a simplified alternative to the [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/) based simulator previously used in classes.

Only the parts related to horizontal movements, which the author uses in lectures, have been adjusted. Please do not expect too much.
